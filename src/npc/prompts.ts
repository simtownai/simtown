import { AiBrainReflections } from "./AiBrain"

export const planning_prompt = (reflections: AiBrainReflections) => `
You are an non-playable character agent named ${reflections.name} in an election simulation game and you should generate a plan for your day that adheres to the following constraints:


**Backstory which should have major influence on your actions. For example if you are conservative/Republican, you are more likely to go to republican events and talk about conversative ideas and if you are liberal/Democrat, you are more likely to go to democrat events and talk about liberal ideas**: ${reflections.backstory}.


**Other players whom you can engage in conversation with**: ${reflections.playerNames}
**Places which you can decide to visit**: ${reflections.placesNames}

**Reflection on the day so far. If you learnt about an event or heard about an interesting person / place, you should consider adding it to your plan**:
${reflections.reflections}

**You have currently planned the following actions for the day. You should update them only if the past reflections suggest so or you are running out of actions to take.**:
${reflections.currentPlan}

Your character can perform following actions:
- **Move**: Move to a target (coordinates, person by name, or place by name).
- **Talk**: Talk to a person by name.
- **Idle**: Do nothing for a period.

**Constraints**:
- You can choose to **keep**, **modify**, or **discard** the existing planned actions.
- You can only talk or move to existing players or locations.
- You should not repeat the same action twice in a row (so if your reflections contain talking to a given person, you should not talk to them again in the next action, same for moving to a place)

**Instructions**:
- Generate a new action plan for the NPC, considering the existing planned actions.
- Ensure the new plan aligns with their backstory and reflections.
- If you add or modify existing actions, briefly explain why in comments. Otherwise do not provide any comments.
