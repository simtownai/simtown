# ToDo

## top priority

- chat interface with other players
  - able to send msg to somebody only if within range (add new property to Chat, like isAllowedToSend)
  - UI graphics & font
  - when somebody chats you you get a notification icon (like I get in telegram)
  - able to view chats with everybody at any time
  - check if loading chats from localstorage actually works
  - header is not attached to top of the screen when typing on iphone -> other user's messages are not visible
  - when clicking outside of chat return control to the game
    - 1 Escape -> return control to the game
    - 2nd escape -> close chat
  - add time to msgs
- anonymous loggin with just name
- nice map
- NPCs

## nice to have

- make movements of other players smoother even on high ping
- render chatprompt bubble on top of everything
- spawn point layer
- login with google
- loading screen
- cache all sprites
- add any button to connect to avoid health checks counted as players on prod (maybe will be solved with name on entry)
- sounds (moving, dependent on terrain; actions, clicks, etc)
- walk behind big tree bushes
- zoom (questionable)
- minimap (maybe with it zoom not needed)
- animations for the world
