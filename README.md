# ToDo

- (Szymon) hunt down TalkAction bugs
  - NPCs are far from each other when start talking
- (Szymon) Optimize prompts
  - listen actions generated when nobody is announced broadcasting at place
  - Going out of character NPC ("as an AI roleplaying NPC")
  - "Player228 decided to end the conversation"
  - NPC's shouldn't broadcast
  - "Player8361 emphasized the urgency to vote, and I need to focus on my upcoming broadcast."
  - "Moving to the Stadium for an important broadcast."
- (Szymon) give NPC's sense of time to prompt
- reflections are gigantic
- unable to generate plan because of errors (like no broadcast announced), but doenst pay atention to that, generates same shit every time and reaches max attempts

- (Alex) player rotations
  - rotate to whom you are sending messages
  - rotate to incoming messages if idle
- (Alex) player can only write to NPC if within range

- `broadcastAnnouncementsCache` is shared among each NPC; update it from the news for each individual npc
- Freeze on movement
  - probably because no actions left
- Generate first message with the talk action
- **refactor planning**
  - problem: new actions objects override old actions objects even they are exactly the same
  - problem: they manually generate move action before some other action which is already implies movement (e.g. move to voting place before vote) -> then they move there, reflect and decide not to vote
  - it has no ability NOT to change current plan
  - `generatePlanAndSetActions` create new action queue and algorithmically merge the two plans, then insert actions
    - this should fix multiple broadcasting emits after resume, because we regenerated the same broadcast task after dialogue and reflection and technically it's a new task (this is currently fixed with `broadcastAnnouncementsCache`)
  - add time & duration to the plan
  - support arbitrary actions (e.g. take a shower, cook breakfast, etc -- only location and time needed)
- gpt generate a reason for every action
- generic OpenAI loop
  - feed prompt, messages and tools, returns result; handles function calls arguments retries; use for generating actions, messaages and voting
  - voting bad because it is not a tool call so it might not be one of candidates
- Plausible analytics
- NPC's thinking as a separate action
- Generate reason for actions when generating the plan
- Black screen on mobile
- add start time to the plan (maybe not need?)
- move action sometimes fails without emitting that it was over
- end NPC movement only on grid
- `emitUpdatePlayerData` sends new state to everybody but doesn't update player itself
- log everything to database
  - NPC's state
  - messages
- movement bugs
  - writes without finishing movement
  - smooth path recalculation when approaching smbd
    - rm this.pathIndex = closestIndex + 1 // Smoothing the direction after recalculation
  - if user went away, let npc know that we left conversation
- chat interface with other players
  - online status (green/red dot, show both on preview and in chat itself) -- Set of existing player + check in set
  - Somebody is typing status
  - able to send msg to somebody only if within range (add new property to Chat, like isAllowedToSend)
  - check if loading chats from localstorage actually works
  - header is not attached to top of the screen when typing on iphone -> other user's messages are not visible
  - (?)when clicking outside of chat return control to the game
  - group chat for humans
- anonymous login with just name

## nice to have

- login with google
- different controls help message for mobile
- make movements of other players smoother even on high ping
- sounds (moving, dependent on terrain; actions, clicks, etc)
- zoom (questionable)
- cache all sprites
- minimap (maybe with it zoom not needed)
- animations for the world
- hide help container when chat opens and vice versa
- enable help menu toggle via "?" but do not listen to it while chat window is opened
- walk behind big tree bushes
